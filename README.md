# Vote Counting System in C (DSA Project)

## Introduction
This project is a **Vote Counting System** implemented in **C** using **linked lists**. The system allows users to vote for candidates while keeping track of the total votes each candidate receives. It also includes an **admin panel** for managing candidates and viewing voting statistics. This is our first **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project**, focusing on dynamic memory allocation and linked list operations.

## Features
- **User Voting System**: Users can cast their votes for candidates.
- **Candidate Management**: Admins can add and remove candidates.
- **Vote Tracking**: The system dynamically updates and stores vote counts using linked lists.
- **Admin Panel**: View vote statistics and manage candidates.
- **Linked List Implementation**: Efficiently stores and updates candidate information.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C
- **Data Structure**: Linked Lists
- **Concepts Applied**: Dynamic Memory Allocation, File Handling (if implemented), and Basic Data Structures

## How to Run the Program
1. **Compile the Code**:
   ```bash
   gcc vote_counting_system.c -o vote_system
   ```
2. **Run the Executable**:
   ```bash
   ./vote_system
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to vote or manage candidates.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement **file handling** to store votes persistently.
- Add a **user authentication** system.
- Improve the **user interface** with better menu navigation.
